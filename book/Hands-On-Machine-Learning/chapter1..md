## Exercises.   
1.  How would you define Machine Learning?
    - 사람이 입력에 대한 결과 도출 방법을 제안하지 않고 데이터를 받은 모델이 스스로 학습하는 형식 

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
   - Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform bettter
   - Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.
   - Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.
   - Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.

3. What is a labeled training set?
    - 
4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
6. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to
walk in various unknown terrains?
7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple
groups?
8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning prob‐
lem or an unsupervised learning problem?
9. What is an online learning system?
10. What is out-of-core learning?
11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predic‐
tions?
12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm’s
hyperparameter?
13. What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common
strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?
14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?
15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new
instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?
16. What is a test set and why would you want to use it?
17. What is the purpose of a validation set?
18. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?
19. What is repeated cross-validation and why would you prefer it to using a single
validation set?
