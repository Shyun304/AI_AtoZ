## Exercises

1. Try a Support Vector Machine regressor (sklearn.svm.SVR), with various hyperparameters such as kernel="linear" (with various values for the C hyperparameter) or kernel="rbf" (with various values for the C and gamma hyperparameters). Donâ€™t worry about what these hyperparameters mean for now. How does the best SVR predictor perform?
2. Try replacing GridSearchCV with RandomizedSearchCV.
3. Try adding a transformer in the preparation pipeline to select only the most important attributes.
4. Try creating a single pipeline that does the full data preparation plus the final prediction.
5. Automatically explore some preparation options using GridSearchCV.
